my name is akhil
i wanted to learn about git today
 
i wrote this line by opening the testing_addfile and then clicked on edit to write this line.

i want to create a new major version which means a new branch so i'm adding this line

done with changes ,now i want to merge this new major version with the old-one

i wanted to update the master branch only even after creating a latest major version, so i used this line

Thank you
